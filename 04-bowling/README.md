## Brief Description
This project consists of three different approaches to implement scoring of bowling games (each one with a different programming paradigm) and a report comparing these approaches.


## Project Structure

### Solution

 Each directory represents a different paradigm: 

- [Procedural Programming](./src/procedural/README.md)
- [Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)](./src/oop/README.md)
- [Pipes-and-Filters](./src/pipes-and-filters/README.md)

Inside each directory, you'll find the source code, input files, and specific instructions on how to run.

### Documentation

The report for the project is contained inside the [`docs`](./docs/) directory.

This directory contains the [problem statement](./docs/problem-statement.pdf) and the project's [report](./src/report.pdf).
